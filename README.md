## UK WAGE CALCULATOR

Top Service is a fictious organisation made/set up for the purpose of the code Institute Assessment/project. None the less its website is much live and not fiction.

The Top Service website is a simple and very effective webiste aimed at customers looking to hire qualified professionals to carry out Gardening, Rubbish collection, Laundry, and House Keeping both in their homes or office.

Users of this website are able to find out which services are provided by TOP Service; use the contact details provided to contact TOP service directly; and submit an enquiry using the Enquiry form.

### Navigation

* The navigation bar is fixed to the top. this way the user has access to the menu from all sections of the website.
* The navigation bar houses links to the Home page; Enquiry Form page; Services section; and Contact Us section.
* The Logo [TOP service] allows the user to easily navigate back to the top of the page as well as return to the Home page if in the Enquiry Form page.


### Home Page

* The Home page has a hero image with cover text [statement of intent for TOP service] superimposed on top.
* Users can easily and smoothly scroll up and down to different sections on the Home page [i.e. Services, Contact Us, and Footer] or the can use the navigation links  links set out in the  navigation bar.

* Accessibility
 * I have validted that accessibility is good. My accessibility report shows a low perfomance report. This is due to the many font awesome icons i have used in this website.

### Bugs and Errors

#### Solved
* I encountered a few errors in HTML and CSS during the build phase. For example, I had created a button inside the anchor tag. After seeing the error from the validation report, i adjusted my code.

* I encountered issues while building the services section layout. The service types were displaying as "two columns side-by-side and two rows" structure that I needed. I solved this by created an outer container to house all service types plus a container for each service type

#### Unsolved

* No errors outstanding
